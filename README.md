## Learning Objectives

### General

-   What is a binary tree
-   What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
-   What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
-   What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
-   What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
-   What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
